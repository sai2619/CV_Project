# Printer Source Classification via GLCM Features of Character 'e'

This project extracts pages from PDF files, identifies occurrences of the letter **'e'**, computes GLCM texture features, and classifies the document's printing source based on pre-learned printer characteristics.

## 📦 Features

- Convert PDF pages into images
- Detect and crop character **'e'**
- Extract texture features using GLCM
- Scale, select, and reduce features
- Train a custom distance-based classifier
- Classify unknown PDF pages based on learned printer patterns
