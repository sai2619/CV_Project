# Printer Source Classification via GLCM Features of Character 'e'

This project extracts pages from PDF files, identifies occurrences of the letter **'e'**, computes GLCM texture features, and classifies the document's printing source based on pre-learned printer characteristics.


**Problem Statement**



## üì¶ Features

- Convert PDF pages into images
- Detect and crop character **'e'**
- Extract texture features using GLCM
- Scale, select, and reduce features
- Train a custom distance-based classifier
- Classify unknown PDF pages based on learned printer patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Install the libraries that have been mentioned in the **Requirements.txt** file.


## Execution of code

1. We will directly run **main.ipynb** file in Google colab or in VSCode with uploading dataset i.e **scanner dataset-20250502T134328Z-1-001.zip** and change its name to **folder.zip** and also we upload **Brother.pdf** and **Xerox_Versalink.PDF**.


## Individual Contributions

1.) **Abhishek Kumar**:

2.) **Abhay**:

3.) **G Sai Prabhath**: Handled the dataset and done my part from **feature reduction** to **Classification(end of the project)**.
